# recipes
Recipes website project as part of The Odin Project

This will be a website consisting of a main index page which will
include links to different recipes.

This will be a very bare-bones HTML project, meant to test my 
current understanding of basic HTML structure, tags, git commits, 
proper commit commenting and general we design practice.
